# Python_Journey

I am currently learning python from PythonÂ® Programming for the Absolute Beginner, Third Edition by Michael Dawson.

You can find my summary note on [Notion](https://vine-hacksaw-a5b.notion.site/Python_Journey-2049343d05fb4c3789f118602fce1acd) . The purpose of this note is simply for the track, revision and summary or if anyone need quick learning.
Hope this will help you on step by step learning.

Thank you
